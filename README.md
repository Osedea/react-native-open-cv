# react-native-open-cv

## Getting started

`$ yarn add react-native-open-cv`

### Mostly automatic installation

`$ cd ios && pod install`

The source files for the OpenCV Android SDK are downloaded by the postinstall script into the android folder. Then files in `androidReactNative` are copied into the android source directories.

## Usage
```javascript
import OSDOpenCv from 'react-native-open-cv';

// TODO: What to do with the module?
OSDOpenCv;
```
